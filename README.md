Penguin Time is a classic platformer game built in C++ and openFrameworks. It follows an estranged penguin's journey to escape the desert. The title was inspired by the Max Ox song [Penguin Time](https://maxox.bandcamp.com/track/penguin-time), which is also featured as the game's soundtrack. All code, art, and animations were created by Adam Aaronson. Â© 2019, All rights reserved.
